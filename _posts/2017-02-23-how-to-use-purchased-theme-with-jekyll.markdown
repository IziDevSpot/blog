In this Tutorial you are going to learn how to  use a purchased theme for your website or blog powered by jekyll.

A theme for Jekyll cost more or less $ 24 dollar on [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/?ref=izidevspot/category/static-site-generators/jekyll). All you have to do is download the zip package of your purchased theme in the folder directory where your project will live.

One extracted you will open a terminal window into the directory of your extracted content where the `_config.yml` is located.

One you are there, you can run the command  `jekyll serve` . Go to your browser window and type the default address/port for your jekyll site : `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`

If everything went fine you will typically see the default content of your purchased theme. Thatâ€™s mean that your theme is working and you can just make the changes and add your customized content. Follow these previous [tutorial]({% post_url 2017-02-22-getting-started-with-jekyll %}) if you are not sure of how to do so.

*Some problems you might encounter :*

**Missing dependencies:** 
If you get this error when trying to serve your new theme you can gent the dependency name on the console and run the command :
Gem install dependency-name

**Page not found:**
The baseurl is responsible of receiving the address of the subpath to launch your website .
On your `_config.yml` your baseurl should stay empty: 

`baseurl: ""`


Hopefully this little tutorial hepled you setting up a [purchased theme](https://themeforest.net/?ref=izidevspot/category/static-site-generators/jekyll) for your website or blog. Namaste !
